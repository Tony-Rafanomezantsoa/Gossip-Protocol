# Gossip Protocol

This project is a minimal implementation of a push-pull gossip protocol for in-memory state dissemination. It is built from scratch and incorporates part of the Chord DHT (Distributed Hash Table) algorithm for peer discovery.

## Features
- **Push-Pull Gossip Protocol**: For state dissemination among peers.
- **Chord DHT Integration**: Peer discovery using the Chord algorithm.
